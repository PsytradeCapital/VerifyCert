# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating comprehensive legal documentation and enhanced demonstration capabilities for VerifyCert. The goal is to provide proper legal coverage through an End User License Agreement (EULA), create detailed project specifications for testing, and enhance the user experience to showcase all functionalities to judges and evaluators without requiring account creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: End User License Agreement (EULA)

**User Story:** As a VerifyCert platform owner, I want a comprehensive EULA that protects the platform legally while clearly defining user rights and responsibilities, so that the platform operates within legal boundaries and users understand their obligations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses VerifyCert THEN the system SHALL display the EULA during onboarding
2. WHEN creating the EULA THEN it SHALL include specific clauses for blockchain certificate verification platforms
3. WHEN defining user responsibilities THEN the EULA SHALL address wallet security, certificate authenticity, and acceptable use
4. WHEN specifying company contact THEN the EULA SHALL use verifycertificate18@gmail.com as the business email
5. WHEN establishing jurisdiction THEN the EULA SHALL specify Kenya as the governing law jurisdiction
6. WHEN addressing liability THEN the EULA SHALL include appropriate limitations for blockchain-based services
7. WHEN covering intellectual property THEN the EULA SHALL clarify ownership of certificates vs platform technology

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Project Specifications

**User Story:** As a developer or tester, I want detailed project specifications that outline all VerifyCert functionalities, so that I can systematically test and validate the complete system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating specifications THEN the system SHALL document all core certificate verification functionalities
2. WHEN documenting UI/UX THEN specifications SHALL cover theme switching, visual consistency, and responsive design
3. WHEN specifying wallet features THEN documentation SHALL include connection, switching, and disconnection workflows
4. WHEN defining system integrity THEN specifications SHALL cover blockchain transactions, error handling, and logging
5. WHEN documenting design standards THEN specifications SHALL ensure uniform styling across all components
6. WHEN covering accessibility THEN specifications SHALL include requirements for inclusive design

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Demo Experience

**User Story:** As a judge or evaluator, I want to see all VerifyCert functionalities including the dashboard without creating an account, so that I can quickly assess the platform's capabilities during evaluation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing VerifyCert as a new user THEN the system SHALL provide a demo mode or guest access
2. WHEN connecting a wallet THEN the system SHALL immediately show dashboard functionality
3. WHEN in demo mode THEN users SHALL be able to view certificate verification workflows
4. WHEN showcasing features THEN the system SHALL maintain existing signup and login functionality
5. WHEN demonstrating capabilities THEN all core features SHALL be accessible without full registration
6. WHEN providing guest access THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate demo vs full account benefits

### Requirement 4: Documentation Integration

**User Story:** As a platform maintainer, I want the EULA and specifications properly integrated into the VerifyCert project structure, so that they are easily accessible and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding documentation THEN files SHALL be placed in appropriate project directories
2. WHEN creating EULA THEN it SHALL be available in both `/docs/EULA.md` and integrated into the onboarding flow
3. WHEN adding specifications THEN they SHALL be stored in `/docs/specifications.md` for reference
4. WHEN integrating documents THEN they SHALL follow the project's markdown formatting standards
5. WHEN updating documentation THEN changes SHALL be version controlled and dated
6. WHEN accessing documents THEN they SHALL be easily discoverable by developers and users

### Requirement 5: Legal Compliance and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want the EULA to follow legal best practices for blockchain and certificate verification platforms, so that the platform is properly protected and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drafting legal terms THEN the EULA SHALL address blockchain-specific risks and limitations
2. WHEN defining user obligations THEN terms SHALL cover certificate authenticity and fraud prevention
3. WHEN specifying platform responsibilities THEN limitations SHALL be appropriate for decentralized systems
4. WHEN addressing data privacy THEN terms SHALL acknowledge blockchain transparency and immutability
5. WHEN covering updates THEN the EULA SHALL allow for platform improvements and modifications
6. WHEN establishing termination conditions THEN terms SHALL be fair and enforceable
