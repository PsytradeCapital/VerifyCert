# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing critical TypeScript compilation errors that are preventing the VerifyCert frontend application from building successfully. The errors are primarily related to import/export issues, TypeScript configuration problems, component prop type mismatches, and missing dependencies. All fixes must maintain existing functionality while resolving compilation issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that the frontend application can build successfully without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN components are imported THEN the system SHALL find all exported members correctly
3. WHEN TypeScript processes the code THEN the system SHALL handle all type definitions properly
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a working application bundle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper import/export statements for all UI components, so that components can be used throughout the application without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is imported THEN the system SHALL find the correct export (default vs named exports)
2. WHEN UI components like Button, Input, Card are used THEN the system SHALL resolve imports correctly
3. WHEN Storybook stories import components THEN the system SHALL find all required dependencies
4. WHEN components reference other components THEN the system SHALL maintain proper module structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript configuration optimized for the project requirements, so that modern JavaScript features and iterations work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript processes Set iterations THEN the system SHALL support spread operator with --downlevelIteration or ES2015+ target
2. WHEN components use modern JavaScript features THEN the system SHALL compile them correctly
3. WHEN type checking runs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate compiler options for the project
4. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized and compatible code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component prop types properly defined and compatible, so that TypeScript can validate component usage without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Framer Motion components are used THEN the system SHALL handle prop type conflicts correctly
2. WHEN component variants and props are passed THEN the system SHALL validate types properly
3. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN the system SHALL match expected function signatures
4. WHEN optional props are used THEN the system SHALL handle undefined values correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing dependencies installed and properly configured, so that imports resolve correctly and development tools work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Storybook stories use addon-actions THEN the system SHALL find the installed dependency
2. WHEN development tools are used THEN the system SHALL have all required packages available
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL not have any missing dependency errors
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL resolve all external dependencies

## Success Criteria

The TypeScript fixes will be considered successful when:
1. Frontend application builds without any TypeScript compilation errors
2. All component imports and exports work correctly
3. Development server starts without errors
4. Storybook builds and runs without issues
5. All existing functionality continues to work as expected
