# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing secure user authentication in VerifyCert. The system will support both email-based and phone number-based authentication to accommodate users from different regions with varying communication preferences. This feature will enable user account management, secure access to issuer dashboards, and personalized certificate management while maintaining the decentralized nature of the certificate verification system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using either my email address or phone number, so that I can access personalized features and manage certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL present options to register with either email or phone number
2. WHEN a user selects email registration THEN the system SHALL require name, email address, and password fields
3. WHEN a user selects phone registration THEN the system SHALL require name, phone number, and password fields
4. WHEN a user enters a phone number THEN the system SHALL validate it against E.164 international format
5. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum 8 characters with at least 1 uppercase, 1 number, and 1 special character
6. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL hash the password and store user data securely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to verify my account through OTP, so that I can confirm my identity and activate my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration with email THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via email using SMTP service
2. WHEN a user completes registration with phone THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via SMS gateway
3. WHEN an OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL set expiration time to 5 minutes
4. WHEN a user enters correct OTP within time limit THEN the system SHALL mark account as verified
5. WHEN OTP expires or is incorrect THEN the system SHALL allow user to request new OTP
6. WHEN account is verified THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account using my credentials, so that I can access protected features and manage my certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL present fields for email/phone and password
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate against stored hashed password
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate and return a JWT token
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message
5. WHEN user account is not verified THEN the system SHALL prompt for OTP verification
6. WHEN JWT token is issued THEN the system SHALL set appropriate expiration time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be secure, so that user data and accounts are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
2. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN login attempts are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
4. WHEN JWT tokens are used THEN the system SHALL validate token signature and expiration
5. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication token
6. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL ensure all communications are encrypted### Requir
ement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support regional preferences for authentication methods, so that I can use the most convenient option for my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the registration page THEN the system SHALL detect user region or allow manual selection
2. WHEN user is in email-preferred regions THEN the system SHALL default to email registration option
3. WHEN user is in mobile-preferred regions THEN the system SHALL default to phone registration option
4. WHEN user wants to override default THEN the system SHALL allow switching between email and phone options
5. WHEN phone validation is required THEN the system SHALL validate format according to regional standards
6. WHEN regional SMS services are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate appropriate SMS gateway for the region

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a certificate issuer, I want to access an authenticated dashboard, so that I can manage my certificate issuance securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses issuer features THEN the system SHALL verify JWT token validity
2. WHEN token is valid THEN the system SHALL grant access to issuer dashboard
3. WHEN token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
4. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current session token
5. WHEN user session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log out and clear stored credentials
6. WHEN issuer permissions are required THEN the system SHALL verify user has appropriate authorization level

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to recover my account if I forget my password, so that I can regain access without losing my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL prompt for email or phone number
2. WHEN valid email/phone is provided THEN the system SHALL send password reset OTP
3. WHEN user enters valid reset OTP THEN the system SHALL allow setting new password
4. WHEN new password is set THEN the system SHALL hash and update stored password
5. WHEN password reset is complete THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing JWT tokens for that user
6. WHEN reset OTP expires THEN the system SHALL require new reset request

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly with existing VerifyCert features, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain existing certificate verification functionality for public users
2. WHEN user authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update UI components accordingly
3. WHEN authenticated features are accessed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle unauthenticated requests
4. WHEN database schema is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing certificate data
5. WHEN API endpoints are added THEN the system SHALL follow existing VerifyCert API patterns and conventions
6. WHEN frontend components are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design and accessibility standards
