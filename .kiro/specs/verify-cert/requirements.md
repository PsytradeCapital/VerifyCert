# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VerifyCert is a blockchain-based digital certificate verification system that enables institutions to issue tamper-proof certificates as non-transferable NFTs. The system provides a complete solution for certificate issuance, storage, and verification using smart contracts on the Polygon Mumbai network, with a user-friendly web interface for all stakeholders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authorized institution (school, company, online course platform), I want to issue digital certificates to individuals, so that I can provide verifiable credentials that cannot be forged or tampered with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authorized issuer connects their MetaMask wallet THEN the system SHALL authenticate their issuer status
2. WHEN an issuer fills out certificate details (recipient name, course/achievement, date, institution) THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
3. WHEN an issuer submits a certificate for minting THEN the system SHALL create a non-transferable NFT on the Polygon Mumbai blockchain
4. WHEN a certificate is successfully minted THEN the system SHALL generate a unique QR code and verification link
5. WHEN a certificate is issued THEN the system SHALL provide options to email the certificate or share via link

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a certificate recipient, I want to receive and view my digital certificate, so that I can share my verified credentials with employers or other parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a certificate is issued to me THEN I SHALL receive it via email or shareable link
2. WHEN I access my certificate THEN the system SHALL display all certificate details in a user-friendly format
3. WHEN I view my certificate THEN the system SHALL show the QR code for quick verification
4. WHEN I access my certificate THEN the system SHALL provide options to download or share the certificate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a verifier (employer, institution, third party), I want to verify the authenticity of a digital certificate, so that I can confirm the credentials are legitimate and unaltered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scan a certificate QR code THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the public verification page
2. WHEN I access a verification link THEN the system SHALL display the certificate details from blockchain data
3. WHEN viewing a certificate for verification THEN the system SHALL show issuer information, recipient details, and issuance date
4. WHEN verifying a certificate THEN the system SHALL confirm the certificate exists on the blockchain and is authentic
5. IF a certificate does not exist or has been tampered with THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an institution administrator, I want to manage my organization's certificate issuance, so that I can control who can issue certificates and track issued credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the issuer dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all certificates issued by my institution
2. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show certificate statistics and recent activity
3. WHEN I need to authorize new issuers THEN the system SHALL provide controls to manage issuer permissions
4. WHEN viewing issued certificates THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and searching by recipient, date, or certificate type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to connect my MetaMask wallet securely, so that I can interact with the blockchain functionality safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clear wallet connection option
2. WHEN I click connect wallet THEN the system SHALL prompt MetaMask connection
3. WHEN my wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display my wallet address and connection status
4. WHEN I disconnect my wallet THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and return to disconnected state
5. IF MetaMask is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want smart contracts that handle certificate minting and storage securely, so that the certificates are immutable and verifiable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a certificate is minted THEN the smart contract SHALL store all certificate data immutably
2. WHEN storing certificate data THEN the smart contract SHALL ensure certificates are non-transferable
3. WHEN querying certificate data THEN the smart contract SHALL return all stored information for verification
4. WHEN unauthorized users attempt to mint THEN the smart contract SHALL reject the transaction
5. WHEN the contract is deployed THEN it SHALL be verified on the Polygon Mumbai network

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend API to handle certificate operations efficiently, so that the frontend can provide a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests certificate minting THEN the API SHALL interact with the smart contract securely
2. WHEN certificate data is requested THEN the API SHALL retrieve information from the blockchain
3. WHEN generating QR codes THEN the API SHALL create unique codes linking to verification pages
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the API SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the frontend
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the API SHALL validate all input data before blockchain interactions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As any user of the system, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate and use all features regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application on any device THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation and loading states
3. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and status updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN I use the application THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible and follow web standards
