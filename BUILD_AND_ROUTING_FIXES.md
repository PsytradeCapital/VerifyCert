# Build and Routing Fixes

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### 1. Home.tsx Syntax Error âœ…
**Problem**: Corrupted JSX structure around line 132 causing build failure
**Solution**: Completely recreated the Home.tsx file with:
- Proper JSX structure and closing tags
- All dark mode classes for text visibility
- Feature cards with proper styling
- Added `feature-card` classes for theme targeting
- Fixed all text elements with `dark:text-white` and `dark:text-gray-300`

### 2. Signup 404 Error âœ…
**Problem**: Users accessing `/signup` were getting 404 errors
**Root Cause**: Only `/register` route existed, but users expected `/signup`
**Solution**: Added both routes pointing to the same SignupPage component:

```tsx
// Existing route
<Route path="/register" element={<SignupPage />} />

// Added route for common expectation
<Route path="/signup" element={<SignupPage />} />
```
