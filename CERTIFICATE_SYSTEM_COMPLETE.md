## Data Flow

### Certificate Issuance
1. Authorized issuer submits certificate data
2. Backend validates input and authorization
3. Smart contract mints non-transferable NFT
4. Push notification sent to recipient
5. Transaction receipt returned with certificate details

### Certificate Verification
1. User provides certificate ID or file
2. Backend validates input format
3. Smart contract queried for certificate data
4. Blockchain proof retrieved
5. Verification result displayed with certificate details
