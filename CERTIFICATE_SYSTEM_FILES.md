### 5. Certificate Verification API (`backend/routes/verifyCertificate.js`)

**Purpose**: Express.js API routes for certificate verification

**Key Features**:
- Verification by certificate hash
- Verification by token ID
- Issuer certificate listing with pagination
- Certificate statistics
- Comprehensive error handling
- Blockchain network error handling

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/certificates/verify/:hash` - Verify by hash
- `GET /api/certificates/verify/token/:tokenId` - Verify by token ID
- `GET /api/certificates/issuer/:address` - Get certificates by issuer
- `GET /api/certificates/stats` - Get certificate statistics

## Integration Points
