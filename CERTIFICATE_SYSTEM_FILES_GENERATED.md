## Usage Examples

### Minting a Certificate
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/certificates/mint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    recipientAddress: '0x...',
    recipientName: 'John Doe',
    courseName: 'Blockchain Development',
    institutionName: 'Tech University',
    expiryDate: 1735689600 // Optional
  })
});
```

### Verifying a Certificate
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/certificates/verify/${certificateHash}`);
const { data } = await response.json();
// data contains verification status and certificate details
```

### Using the Certificate Card Component
```jsx
<CertificateCard
  certificate={certificateData}
  variant="premium"
  showActions={true}
  showQRCode={true}
  onVerify={() => window.open(`/verify/${certificate.hash}`)}
  onShare={() => handleShare(certificate)}
  onDownload={() => handleDownload(certificate)}
/>
```
