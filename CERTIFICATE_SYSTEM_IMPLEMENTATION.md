  - Gas estimation endpoint
  - Rate limiting for security
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - QR code generation
  - Transaction status checking
  - Retry logic for failed transactions

### 4. Certificate Verification Page (`frontend/pages/verify.jsx`)

- **Features**:
  - Multiple verification methods (hash, QR upload, camera scan)
  - Enhanced UI components integration
  - Smooth page transitions and animations
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Real-time verification status display
  - Certificate sharing functionality
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 5. Certificate Verification API (`backend/routes/verifyCertificate.js`)
- **Purpose**: Backend API routes for certificate verification
- **Features**:
  - Verification by certificate hash
  - Verification by token ID
  - Issuer certificate listing with pagination
  - Certificate statistics endpoint
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Network error resilience
  - Detailed response formatting

## Key Enhancements

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Design System Integration**: All components use the centralized design system
2. **Enhanced Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant with proper ARIA attributes
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and loading spinners
6. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options

### Technical Improvements
1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
2. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and bundle splitting
3. **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and sanitization
4. **Reliability**: Retry logic, error recovery, and graceful degradation
5. **Scalability**: Batch operations and pagination support

### Smart Contract Features
1. **Non-transferable NFTs**: Certificates cannot be transferred between addresses
2. **Role-based Access**: Only authorized issuers can mint certificates
3. **Verification Methods**: Multiple ways to verify certificate authenticity
4. **Revocation Support**: Certificates can be revoked by issuers
5. **Gas Optimization**: Efficient storage and operations

## Integration Points

### Frontend to Backend
- API calls for certificate verification
- File upload handling for QR codes
- Real-time status updates
- Error state management

### Backend to Blockchain
- Smart contract interaction via ethers.js
- Transaction monitoring and confirmation
- Gas estimation and optimization
- Event parsing and data extraction

### Component Architecture
- Reusable UI components from design system
- Consistent styling and behavior
- Proper state management
- Event handling and callbacks

## Usage Examples

### Minting a Certificate
```javascript
POST /api/certificates/mint
{
  "recipientAddress": "0x...",
  "recipientName": "John Doe",
  "courseName": "Blockchain Development",
  "institutionName": "Tech University",
  "expiryDate": 1735689600
}
```

### Verifying a Certificate
```javascript
GET /api/certificates/verify/abc123...
```

### Displaying a Certificate
```jsx
<CertificateCard
  certificate={certificateData}
  variant="premium"
  showActions={true}
  showQRCode={true}
/>
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated on both frontend and backend
2. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse
3. **Access Control**: Only authorized issuers can mint certificates
4. **Data Integrity**: Certificate hashes ensure data hasn't been tampered with
5. **Network Security**: Proper error handling for blockchain network issues

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**: Components are lazy-loaded when needed
2. **Image Optimization**: QR codes and images are optimized for web
3. **Caching**: API responses are cached where appropriate
4. **Bundle Size**: Tree shaking removes unused code
5. **Gas Optimization**: Smart contract operations are gas-efficient

## Future Enhancements

1. **IPFS Integration**: Store certificate metadata on IPFS
2. **Multi-chain Support**: Deploy on multiple blockchain networks
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Certificate issuance and verification metrics
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for certificate management
5. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready certificate verification system with modern UI/UX design and robust backend infrastructure.
