## 📋 Next Steps

The certificate system is now fully functional and ready for use. You can:

1. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   # Test authentication system
   node test-auth-system.js
   
   # Test certificate system
   node test-certificate-system.js
   ```

3. **Deploy to production**:
   - Backend: Use PM2 or Docker
   - Frontend: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
   - Smart Contract: Already deployed on Polygon Amoy
