# React Import Fix for VerifyCert

## Issue Identified
The build was failing with TypeScript error:
```
TS2686: 'React' refers to a UMD global, but the current file is a module. Consider adding an import instead.
```

## Root Cause
Several React components were importing hooks like `useState` but not importing `React` itself, which is required for JSX in TypeScript.

## Files Fixed
I've added `React` imports to the following files:

1. `frontend/src/components/CertificateCard.tsx`
2. `frontend/src/pages/Verify.tsx`
3. `frontend/src/pages/VerificationPage.tsx`
4. `frontend/src/pages/IssuerDashboard.tsx`
5. `frontend/src/pages/CertificateViewer.tsx`
6. `frontend/src/components/ui/Modal/Modal.stories.tsx`

## Changes Made
Changed from:
```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';
```

To:
```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

## Test the Fix

### Option 1: Test Locally
```bash
node test-build-fix.js
```

### Option 2: Test in Frontend Directory
```bash
cd frontend
npx craco build
```

### Option 3: Commit and Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix React imports for TypeScript build"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
✅ Build should now complete successfully without TypeScript errors
✅ Both CRACO and react-scripts builds should work
✅ Deployment to Netlify/Vercel should succeed

The React import fixes should resolve the TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing successful deployment.
