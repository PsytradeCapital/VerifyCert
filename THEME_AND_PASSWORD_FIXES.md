# Theme and Password Change Fixes

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### 1. "Connected Successful" Error - RESOLVED âœ…
**Problem**: The change password functionality was failing due to backend route issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend route was expecting `req.user.verifyPassword()` and `req.user.updatePassword()` methods that didn't exist
- Complex middleware dependencies that weren't properly implemented

**Solution**:
- Simplified the backend route to use direct database operations
- Used `bcrypt.compare()` for password verification
- Used direct SQL queries for password updates
- Removed unnecessary middleware dependencies

**Fixed Code**:
```javascript
// backend/src/routes/user.js
router.put('/change-password', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { currentPassword, newPassword } = req.body;
    
    // Get user's current password hash
    const user = await db.get('SELECT password_hash FROM users WHERE id = ?', [req.user.id]);
    
    // Verify current password
    const isCurrentPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(currentPassword, user.password_hash);
    
    // Hash and update new password
    const newPasswordHash = await bcrypt.hash(newPassword, 12);
    await db.run('UPDATE users SET password_hash = ? WHERE id = ?', [newPasswordHash, req.user.id]);
    
    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Password changed successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: 'Failed to change password' });
  }
});
```

### 2. Text Visibility Issues - RESOLVED âœ…
**Problem**: Text was invisible when switching between dark and light themes.

**Root Cause**: 
- Inconsistent color inheritance
- Missing theme-specific color overrides
- Conflicting CSS classes

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `theme-fixes.css` with aggressive color overrides
- Used `!important` declarations to ensure theme colors take precedence
- Added universal selectors for all text elements
- Implemented smooth transitions between themes

**Key CSS Rules**:
```css
/* Universal text fixes */
[data-theme="light"] * {
  color: #1f2937 !important;
}

[data-theme="dark"] * {
  color: #f8fafc !important;
}

/* Specific element overrides */
[data-theme="light"] h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #111827 !important;
}

[data-theme="dark"] h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #ffffff !important;
}
```

### 3. LoadingButton Props - RESOLVED âœ…
**Problem**: ChangePasswordForm was using incorrect prop names for LoadingButton.

**Solution**:
- Changed `loading={isLoading}` to `isLoading={isLoading}`
- Added `loadingText="Changing Password..."` prop
- Removed conditional text rendering from children
