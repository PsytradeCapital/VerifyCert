   - Academic institutions (for transfer credits)
   - Professional licensing bodies
   - Background verification services

## Testing Methodology

### Pre-Testing Setup

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Set up testing environment with latest application build
   - Prepare test certificates and sample data
   - Configure screen recording software
   - Set up feedback collection system

2. **Participant Recruitment**
   - Recruit 5-8 participants per user group
   - Ensure diverse backgrounds and technical skill levels
   - Schedule 60-90 minute sessions

3. **Testing Materials**
   - User scenarios and tasks
   - Pre-test questionnaire
   - Post-test feedback forms
   - System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire

### Testing Scenarios

#### For Institutions (Certificate Issuers)

**Scenario 1: First-time Setup**

- Success criteria: Complete setup within 10 minutes

**Scenario 2: Certificate Issuance**
- Task: Issue a certificate to a student
- Focus: Form usability, workflow efficiency
- Success criteria: Successfully issue certificate without assistance

**Scenario 3: Dashboard Management**
- Task: View issued certificates and manage settings
- Focus: Information architecture, visual design
- Success criteria: Find and complete tasks intuitively

#### For Verifiers

**Scenario 1: Certificate Verification**
- Task: Verify a certificate using QR code or link
- Focus: Verification process clarity, trust indicators
- Success criteria: Successfully verify and understand results

**Scenario 2: Bulk Verification**
- Task: Verify multiple certificates for hiring process
- Focus: Efficiency, batch operations
- Success criteria: Complete verification workflow efficiently

**Scenario 3: Mobile Verification**
- Task: Verify certificate on mobile device
- Focus: Mobile responsiveness, touch interactions
- Success criteria: Seamless mobile experience

### Data Collection Methods

#### Quantitative Metrics
- Task completion rates
- Time to complete tasks
- Error rates and recovery
- System Usability Scale (SUS) scores
- Navigation path analysis

#### Qualitative Feedback
- Think-aloud protocol observations
- Post-task interviews
- Satisfaction ratings
- Pain point identification
- Improvement suggestions

## Testing Protocol

### Session Structure (90 minutes)

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Welcome and consent
   - Explain think-aloud protocol
   - Set expectations

2. **Pre-test Questionnaire (10 minutes)**
   - Background information
   - Technical experience
   - Current certificate management practices

3. **Task Execution (50 minutes)**
   - Guided scenarios with think-aloud
   - Minimal intervention approach
   - Note-taking and observation

4. **Post-test Interview (15 minutes)**
   - Overall impressions
   - Specific feedback on design elements
   - Improvement suggestions

5. **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**
   - Thank participant
   - Next steps explanation

### Observation Guidelines

#### Navigation Feedback Focus Areas
- Menu structure and labeling
- Information architecture
- Breadcrumb usage
- Search functionality
- Mobile navigation patterns

#### Visual Design Focus Areas
- Color scheme and contrast
- Typography readability
- Icon recognition
- Layout consistency
- Visual hierarchy

#### Overall Experience Focus Areas
- Perceived trustworthiness
- Emotional response
- Cognitive load
- Error handling
- Help and documentation

## Data Analysis Framework

### Quantitative Analysis
- Calculate task success rates
- Measure average completion times
- Identify common error patterns
- Compute SUS scores and benchmarks

### Qualitative Analysis
- Thematic analysis of feedback
- Categorize issues by severity
- Map problems to specific UI elements
- Identify recurring themes

### Priority Matrix
Rate issues on two dimensions:
- **Impact**: High/Medium/Low user impact
- **Frequency**: How often the issue occurs

Priority levels:
- **Critical**: High impact, High frequency
- **High**: High impact, Medium frequency OR Medium impact, High frequency
- **Medium**: Medium impact, Medium frequency
- **Low**: Low impact, any frequency OR any impact, Low frequency
