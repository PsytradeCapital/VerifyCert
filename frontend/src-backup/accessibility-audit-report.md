# Keyboard Navigation Accessibility Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the current state of keyboard navigation support across all UI components in the VerifyCert application and provides recommendations for improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Audit Scope

The audit covered the following component categories:
- Navigation components (SideNavigation, BottomNavigation, Breadcrumbs, FloatingActionButton)
- Form components (Button, Input, Select)
- Layout components (Modal, Card, AppLayout)
- Interactive components (ThemeToggle, WalletConnect)

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Components with Good Keyboard Support

#### 1. Button Component (`/components/ui/Button/Button.tsx`)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- **Keyboard Support**: Full
- **Features**:
  - Proper focus management with `focus:outline-none` and custom focus styles
  - Disabled state properly prevents keyboard interaction
  - Loading state maintains accessibility
  - Supports all standard button keyboard interactions (Enter, Space)

#### 2. Input Component (`/components/ui/Input/Input.tsx`)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- **Keyboard Support**: Full
- **Features**:
  - Proper label association
  - Focus management with custom focus styles
  - Error state announcements
  - Standard input keyboard navigation

#### 3. Modal Component (`/components/ui/Modal/Modal.tsx`)
- **Status**: MOSTLY COMPLIANT
- **Keyboard Support**: Good
- **Features**:
  - Escape key handling for closing
  - Focus trap implementation
  - Proper ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`)
  - Focus management on open/close
- **Minor Issues**:
  - Could benefit from better focus restoration
  - Tab trapping could be more robust

### ⚠️ Components with Partial Keyboard Support

#### 4. Select Component (`/components/ui/Select/Select.tsx`)
- **Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT
- **Keyboard Support**: Good but incomplete
- **Current Features**:
  - Basic keyboard navigation for trigger button
  - Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`)
  - Clear button has keyboard support
- **Missing Features**:
  - Arrow key navigation within dropdown options
  - Enter/Space key selection of options
  - Escape key to close dropdown
  - Home/End key navigation
  - Type-ahead search functionality

#### 5. Navigation Components
- **SideNavigation**: Good keyboard support with proper focus management
- **BottomNavigation**: Basic keyboard support but could be enhanced
- **Breadcrumbs**: Good keyboard support for links
- **FloatingActionButton**: Good keyboard support

#### 6. Main Navigation Component (`/components/Navigation.tsx`)
- **Status**: MOSTLY COMPLIANT
- **Current Features**:
  - Proper focus management
  - Mobile menu keyboard toggle
  - ARIA attributes for mobile menu
- **Minor Issues**:
  - Could benefit from skip links
  - Arrow key navigation between items

### ❌ Components with Limited Keyboard Support

#### 7. Card Component (`/components/ui/Card/Card.tsx`)
- **Status**: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- **Issues**:
  - Clickable cards don't have proper keyboard support
  - Missing `tabIndex`, `role`, and keyboard event handlers
  - No focus indicators for interactive cards

#### 8. AppLayout Component (`/components/ui/Layout/AppLayout.tsx`)
- **Status**: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- **Issues**:
  - Missing skip navigation links
  - Sidebar toggle could be more accessible
  - Focus management during responsive changes

## Detailed Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes

#### 1. Enhance Select Component Keyboard Navigation
- Add arrow key navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- Implement Enter/Space key selection
- Add Escape key to close dropdown
- Implement Home/End key navigation
- Add type-ahead functionality

#### 2. Fix Card Component Accessibility
- Add proper keyboard support for interactive cards
- Implement focus indicators
- Add proper ARIA attributes

#### 3. Add Skip Navigation Links
- Implement "Skip to main content" link
- Add "Skip to navigation" option

### Medium Priority Improvements

#### 4. Enhance Modal Focus Management
- Implement robust focus trapping
- Improve focus restoration
- Add better keyboard navigation within modal content

#### 5. Improve Navigation Components
- Add arrow key navigation between navigation items
- Enhance mobile menu keyboard experience
- Implement better focus management during responsive changes

### Low Priority Enhancements

#### 6. Add Keyboard Shortcuts
- Implement global keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Alt+M for menu)
- Add component-specific shortcuts where appropriate

#### 7. Enhance Animation Accessibility
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Ensure animations don't interfere with keyboard navigation

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical - Complete First)
1. Fix Select component keyboard navigation
2. Add Card component keyboard support
3. Implement skip navigation links

### Phase 2 (Important - Complete Second)
1. Enhance Modal focus management
2. Improve navigation keyboard experience
3. Add comprehensive focus indicators

### Phase 3 (Enhancement - Complete Last)
1. Add keyboard shortcuts
2. Enhance animation accessibility
3. Add advanced navigation features

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
- Test all components using only keyboard navigation
- Verify tab order is logical and complete
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Verify focus indicators are visible and clear

### Automated Testing
- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Implement keyboard navigation tests in component test suites
- Add accessibility regression tests

## Compliance Status

- **Current WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: ~75%
- **Target WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: 100%
- **Estimated Implementation Time**: 2-3 days

## Success Criteria

The keyboard navigation audit will be considered complete when:
1. All interactive components are fully keyboard accessible
2. Tab order is logical throughout the application
3. Focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements
4. All components pass automated accessibility tests
5. Manual keyboard navigation testing shows no blocking issues
6. Screen reader testing confirms proper announcements and navigation
